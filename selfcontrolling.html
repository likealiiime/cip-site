					<h2>Control Yourself</h2>
					<p>
						One of CIP&rsquo;s guiding pricinciples is <em>self-control</em>.
						Self-controlling components and objects are able to request their own
						data, process it, present it, and handle interactions with it. Self-controlling
						components are helpful because they are drop-in replacements for less-capable
						components and even entire systems. For instance, the <code>CIButton</code> component is
						able to make <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, and
						<code>DELETE</code> requests, render itself, re-render itself differently while
						requesting, and delegate the response when the requesting is finished. In
						other frameworks, this process might require an object to request the data,
						an object to format incoming or outgoing data, an object to encapsulate an
						error, the button itself, and a controller object or function to handle the
						logistics of requesting, changing states, updating the button, and handling
						a response.
					</p><p>

					</p><p>
						Self-controlling components use a variety of techniques, mainly mixins and
						delegation. <em>Mixins</em> are encapsulated methods that can be added to
						existing classes on-the-fly. In CIP, mixins are used to &ldquo;bundle up&rdquo;
						reusable functionality without subclassing, similar to Java&rsquo;s interfaces,
						Ruby&rsquo;s modules and Objective-C&rsquo;s categories. The mixin
						to give components the ability to make requests is <code>CIRequestable</code>,
						which we&rsquo;ll explore in <a href="selfcontrolling-cirequestable.html#start">the next section</a>.
					</p><p>
						<em>Delegation</em> is a design pattern whereby one object relinquishes
						decisions to another. An object can support more uses
						and scenarios by delegating the responsibility of implementation to another
						object or function. We have already seen one example of delegation in CIP &mdash;
						<code>CIRect</code> delegates measurement logic to its view. The view is free
						to provide a <code>Number</code> or a <code>CIResizeBehavior</code>, which can delegate
						the responsibility of measurement to yet another view. In our self-controlling button example,
						the button relies on a <code>CIRequest</code> object to handle the requesting,
						but that request object delegates responsibility for handling the request to the calling
						parent via its callback methods.
