					<h1>Foundation</h1>
					<p>
						The Foundation kit includes everything you need to get started.
					</p>
					<p>
						Just by extending <strong>CIObject</strong>,
						your objects will receive <strong>key-value coding</strong>, <strong>property synthesis</strong>,
						an <strong>object hierarchy</strong>, and <strong>events</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Extend <strong>CIView</strong> to create visual components with <strong>subviews</strong>,
						a bounding <strong>frame</strong>, <strong>dynamic resizing</strong>, and the <strong>unrender/render</strong> mechanism &ndash;
						again, <strong>all for free</strong>.

					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					
					<h3>Q: Why MooTools? Why not jQuery, Dojo, Prototype, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>?</h3>
					<h3>A: MooTools is lean, object-minded, and active.</h3>
					<p>
						MooTools has just the right mix of lean-ness, extensibility, object-orientation and community for CIP. MooTools Core
						weighs only 65kb when YUI-compressed, yet the entire Foundation Kit runs on it. It is designed for the object-oriented
						programmer and focuses on dealing with Elements, data structures, and common web constructs like AJAX and cookies in
						an object-oriented way. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the imperative styles of other libraries, but CIP focuses on
						the object-oriented paradigm with its classes, delegates, mixins and methods.
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<h3>Q: This looks like a lot of typing. Why is CIP so verbose?</h3>
					<h3>A: You type 100+wpm. Stop complaining.</h3>
					<p>
						Sure, there are some long constant and method names. CIP borrows Cocoas&rsquo;s method signature language, which is
						descriptive and self-documenting (and a function of Objective-C&rsquo;s method names). For instance, which of these
						methods adds a subview to the beginning of the array: <code>push</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>,
						<code>add</code>, or <code>addSubviewToBeginning</code>? Get the picture?
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<h3>Q: I wasn&rsquo;t talking about names. Why does it take so much code to set up a <code>CIVIew</code>, for instance?</h3>
					<h3>A: It&rsquo;s all about process and consistency.</h3>
					<p>
						We do wish some of the initialization code could live elsewhere &mdash; <code>this.isA('Class')</code> is
						<em>so</em> 1999. But the majority of the boring initialization code is about process, which leads to consistent
						results. For example, by using <code>synthesize</code>, you&rsquo;s telling the world exactly what they can, and
						cannot, access. Furthermore, you&rsquo;re giving other objects a guaranteed way to access your data. Without this
						level of consistency, key-value observing would not be possible.
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<h3>Q: If CIP is such a modern framework, why do we have to hand-code HTML and CSS?</h3>
					<h3>A: Because all you have is HTML and CSS.</h3>
					<p>
						Don&rsquo;t be tempted by the wiles of abstraction. It&rsquo;s one thing to abstract away the many layers of
						machinations of packets, protocols and ports with <code>NSConnection</code>/<code>java.net.HttpURLConnection</code>/<code>Net::HTTP</code>.
						But to abstract away the presentation and structural layers of the entire web is just silly. Your app lives on a
						web server, which distributes HTML, CSS and JS, and is delivered to a web browser, which consumes HTML, CSS, and JS.
						The way we see it, there&rsquo;s nothing to abstract or hide.
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<h3>Q: How modern is modern? What is CIP&rsquo;s stance on HTML and CSS3?</h3>
					<h3>A: Go for it, but degrade gracefully.</h3>
					<p>
						While the Foundation Kit does not make any presentation decisions, CIP does have a UI Kit. It uses both CSS3
						and HTML5 to their fullest. With the compliance, speed, and capability of modern browsers like Google Chrome,
						Apple Safari, (Opera) Opera and Mozilla Firefox, there&rsquo;s no reason to keep your code in the dark ages.
						Having said that, it&rsquo;s important to realize some people are stuck using less modern browsers. To that end,
						gracefully degrading your views is a nice solution.
