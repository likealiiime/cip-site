						Let&rsquo;s pretend we have a web application. Right now it&rsquo;s straight Javascript, HTML and CSS. It works,
						but we want to start using more robust, abstracted components and start working with more Javascript so the
						application will be easier to use, more responsive and easier to develop at a higher level. Using CIP gives us
						the freedom to replace components and views on an ad-hoc basis. Let&rsquo;s also pretend that we want to write our
						components for our application. CIP has an extensive UI kit, but we really just need one or two components, not
						the whole kit-n-kaboodle. We&rsquo;ll introduce <code>CIView</code> concepts by creating a simple button component.
					</p>
					<p>
						All visual components inherit from <code>CIView</code>. It provides an object with the mechanisms it needs
						to behave consistently: a <code>subviews</code> Array property, a <code>CIRect</code> to define its boundaries,
						usage of <code>CIResizeBehavior</code> to describe what happens when it is resized, the <code>_makeElement</code>
						method to lay the immutable structure of the component, and <code>render</code> and <code>unrender</code> methods
						with which to populate the component.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="grid_7 push_1 alpha">
					<p>
						There are four steps to extending <code>CIView</code>:
						<ol>
							<li>Extend and initialize the subclass like any other.</li>
							<li>Programmatically define the structure of the component in the <code>_makeElement</code> method.</li>
							<li>Override the <code>unrender</code> method to remove the mutable content from the component.</li>
							<li>Override the <code>render</code> method, to put content into the component.</li>

					<h2>Element, element. Who&rsquo;s got the element?</h2>
					<p>
						CIP is cognizant of the building blocks of the web, HTML, CSS and Javascript. It doesn&rsquo;t try to abstract away
						all HTML and CSS because there&rsquo;s really no way around using it &mdash; no matter what framework you use,
						your code eventually becomes HTML, CSS and Javascript. So why not take control over it? To that extent, CIP
						requires you to dust off your DOM and CSS knowledge for element creation, unrendering and rendering.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="grid_7 push_1 alpha">
					<p>
						<em>Element creation</em> is the step in which the skeleton of your component is laid. Said skeleton is called
						the <em>immutable structure</em> (IS) because it should be&hellip;immutable. Usually this involves adding
						a few empty container elements, defining event handlers, telling  subviews where they should lay their IS&rsquo;s,
						and then calling <code>render</code>. All of this is handled in your view&rsquo;s <code>_makeElement</code> method,
						which takes one parameter, usually called <code>parent</code>. As you may have guessed, the underscore
						indicates this method is not to be called publicly. When you are ready to put your component on the page, you
						just call its <code>element</code> method, passing the containing HTML element.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <code>element</code> method operates in two modes, depending on whether a parameter is given:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>When given a <code>String</code> or <code>Element</code></strong>, it looks for the given
							<code>Element</code>&rsquo;s <code>id</code> in the DOM using Mootools&rsquo; <code>$</code> method, then passes it to the
							calling object&rsquo;s <code>_makeElement</code> method.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>When given no arguments</strong>, it looks up the calling component&rsquo;s <code>Element</code>
							in the DOM by its <code>id</code> and returns it. It returns <code>null</code> if no <code>Element</code>
							was found.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The use of HTML is integral to creating visual components in CIP. Components are injected into specific
						elements in the DOM, which makes CIP lightweight. You can mix CIP components freely with your
						existing HTML pages &mdash; construct an entire application or just add a few nice touches &mdash; it&rsquo;s up
						to you.

					<h2>Wax on, wax off, unrender, render</h2>

						If the immutable structure is the skeleton of a component, then the <code>unrender</code> and <code>render</code> methods are the muscles.
						<code>Unrender</code>&rsquo;s job is to remove all of the content from the IS, returning the component to the same visual
						state it was in right after it was added to the page. <code>Render</code> first calls <code>unrender</code>, then puts the content into the
						IS, requesting data and styling as necessary.
					</p><p>
						Both methods should fire the <code>CIEvent.Unrendered</code> and <code>CIEvent.Rendered</code>
						events, respectively. By listening for these events, other components can be made to re-render when dependent components have changed without
						having to listen for specific property changes.

						It may seem inefficient, removing content just to add it back, but the <code>render</code>/<code>unrender</code> cycle isn&rsquo;t
						invoked that often, just when a component&rsquo;s representation changes. A component&rsquo;s <em>representation</em> is its visual
						presentation which incorporates its data and state. A button&rsquo;s representation, for example, would rarely change. Its data may just be
						its label and its only state may be its enabled/disabled state. These are both represented directly and require a change of its representation
						no matter what. For more complicated components, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide when it should change its representation.

					<h2>Oh, behave!</h2>
					<p>
						Now you know the basics of extending <code>CIView</code>. Of course, there is much more to a <code>CIView</code> than
						its content. If your view has dimensions, you will want to work with its <code>CIRect</code> frame (another concept
						borrowed from Cocoa). A view&rsquo;s <em>frame</em> is an instance of <code>CIRect</code> that describes a view&rsquo;s
						width, height, coordinates (x and y), positioning behavior, clipping behavior, and resizing behavior.
					</p><p>
						The first three properties are self explanatory. A <code>CIRect</code>&rsquo;s <em>positioning behavior</em>
						corresponds to the CSS <code>position</code> property, while its <em>clipping behavior</em> corresponds to the CSS <code>overflow</code>
						property. The resizing behavior, however, is unique to CIP.
					</p><p>
						<em>Resizing behavior</em> describes how a component&rsquo;s frame <code>CIRect</code> changes its width and height properties. It is
						an instance of <code>CIResizeBehavior</code>. Using <code>CIResizeBehavior</code>, you can tell a <code>CIView</code> that
						its width should always be the same as the browser window; or that it should be the width of the window minus a certain
						amount; or that it should be the width of the window minus the width of another view. You can also tell a view that its height
						should be the same height as its superview; or that its height should be the height of another view plus a certain amount
						depending on whether one of its subviews is visible or not.
					</p>
					<p><img src="images/diagrams/resize_behaviors.png" alt="Resize Behaviors" /></p>
					<p>
						All of this is possible, and much simpler than you might think, due to Javascript&rsquo;s closures. For simplicity,
						<code>CIRect</code> provides common resize behaviors: width/height of window, width/height of superview,
						width/height of a specified view, and height of the tallest subview of a specified view (the black sheep of the provided behaviors).
						Of course, you can you can give <code>CIRect</code> a custom <code>CIResizableBehavior</code> if you want alternate
						resizing logic. Finally, <code>CIResziableBehavior</code> doesn't depend on <code>CIRect</code>, so feel free to use
						it wherever you need to keep one value in sync with another.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				
				<div class="push_1 grid_14 alpha omega">
					<h2>Children of the View</h2>
					<p>
						The final major piece of <code>CIView</code> is its subviews Array. By keeping your component&rsquo;s child views
						in <code>CIView#subviews</code>, you can take advantage of how CIP handles window resizing. And subviews is key-value-compliant,
						so other views can be notified when components lose or gain a subviews. This is useful for container components with
						content that changes frequently.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="clear withSpace"></div>
				
				<div class="push_1 grid_14 alpha omega example">
					<h2>Finishing and using EXButton</h2>
					<p>
						Our example button won&rsquo;t deal with a frame or subviews, but we do need to give it a click event handler.
					</p>
					<p class="codeblock" lang="5">
							...
							unrender: function() { ... },
							render: function() { ... },
						
							_clicked: function(<dfn title="Adhering to a Javascript convention, the first argument of action-oriented event handlers is the [[Event]] object. Note that this object is of type [[Mootools.Event]]. It contains information about the click such as location.">event</dfn>) {
								<dfn title="All we need to do is fire the [[CIEvent.Clicked]] event on this object, passing the event object, so listeners can respond to it. It may take a while to wrap your head around th event-driven model, but it&rsquo;s very important that you do.">this.fireEvent(CIEvent.Clicked, event)</dfn>;
							}
						}); // end of our EXButton Class
					</p>
					<p>Now we can use our EXButton to do things when clicked:</p>
					<p class="codeblock" lang="5">
						var myButton = new EXButton({
							text: 'Click me!',
							<dfn title="This is a shortcut. [[CIObject]] knows to look for [[CIEvent]] event names in its configuration, and turn them into event listeners">Clicked:</dfn> function(event) { alert('Hello, World!'); }
						});
						myButton.<dfn title="Here, [[element]] puts our button in a container [[Element]]. As you can see, it&rsquo;s up to the component to decide how it should be added to the DOM. Our component just becomes the last child of its parent, but some components are injected into the top of the [[body]], for example.">element($('myPlaceWithTheButtons'))</dfn>;
